                            <p> I learned the importance of animated designs for websites for different purposese. I was also able to see a lot of amazing examples of modern websites. It is interesting to see the cursor/how the user navigates the page. </p>

                            <p> My favorite part of this article is that it is all consisted of gifs that shows the user's interactions with different webpages for various use purposes. I feel like I can come back to this blog and draw inspiration for whatever website I will be working on. These examples make me think how we can both make a page look cool and make it accesible/easy to use for users. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I especially like the design of a nike shoe purchase page. I like how the show changes in sizes and color according to the user's selection, it is very intuitive and make it easy for the user to visualize their selection. I do wonder how they can prompt the user to swipe left on the right side to start with though. Other than that, it is a very cool idea and I can see it being implemented.  </p>
