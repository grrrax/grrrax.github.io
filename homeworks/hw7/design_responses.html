					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the many ways that objects can be seen as related or in a group. This is very important in UI/UX design because it is important for designers to know how the user intuitively associate the elements and how to group them so that it makes the most sense. I like the website skeletons that they have given to visualize each type of grouping.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like the example skeletons websites that they provided. I feel like it will definitely be helpful when I create a website in the future to refer to these templates. I also could recall websites that I remember that use similar designs, which means they're pretty practical. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Always remember that you are absolutely unique. </p>
