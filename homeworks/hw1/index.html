    Hi! My name is Grace, and I am a junior at the University of California, Berkeley, 
    majoring in Business Administration, Economics, and Art Practice. I’m currently 
    exploring different fields of business, including marketing and investment. 
    As a self-starter, I’m always excited to take on new challenges curious to try out 
    new things in my free time!
</p>
My three favorite places to eat at Berkeley are:
<ul>
    <li>Poke Bar</li>
    <li>Noodle Dynasty</li>
    <li>Punjabidaba</li>
</ul>

    <li>I learned from this article that it is important to take notes of 
        how app developers design the user experience by paying attention 
        to how an app/webpage is designed. I learned that a simple phrase 
        an evoke unexpectedly significant user response, and what to put 
        and what not to put on the page matters a lot. </li>
    <li>My favorite part of this article is all the gifs that breaks down 
        the construction of an app/webpage. It's very interesting to see 
        how everything come together and what purposes each individual 
        piece bring to the whole picture. </li>
    <li>"By routinely analyzing other apps, you’ll develop your product 
        thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
    <li>I enjoyed reading this article 9/10 :)</li>
