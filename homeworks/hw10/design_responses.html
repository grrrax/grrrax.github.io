							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article is interesting because it made me think more about different types of human attention, and how that is related to UI/UX design. I liked the examples that the article provided like driving and talking, and listening to a lecture, then tying it back to UI/UX design. It is good to think about the goal of UI/UX design as achieving sustained attention on the webpage, like in a lecture. I do wish this article provided more visual examples of how some websites can capture user attention and some cannot though. I'm surprised that it is so short. </p>

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p> 6, because I think it could've been a lot more fleshed out with more visual examples. </p>
