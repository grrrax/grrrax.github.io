						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned the importance of type, which I underestimated before. I learned that a good type will serve the purpose of the website. Type pairing of 2-3 different fonts for a website is ideal, and it's common that the fonts are very different. There are also mathematical rules that you can follow for choosing the font sizes.  </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is the number of links that the blog writer provided, there are a lot of good resources that you can refer back to. They also provided pictures that help me visualize what he is talking about, they're very modern/excellent examples. I really feel like this article gave me a good start to start being more conscious and thinking more about typology. </p>
